# Hi there üëã 

My name is Reeve Jarvis, and I am an aspiring developer starting a new career in the tech industry.


## About me:

I am 29 years old, and over the past two years I have been working towards completing the Web and Mobile App Development program at North Island College. Recently graduated in high standing, I am currently searching for gainful employment. 

Throughout my program I developed skills in the following areas:

 - Applied JavaScript techniques for modern web development
 - Advanced CSS techniques for modern web development
 - PHP programming and database integrations
 - Content Management Systems and Wordpress development
 - Advanced App Development for both iOS and Android
 - Project Management best practices
 - Social Media Management solutions

My primary interest is front-end web development, using languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP and their associated frameworks to build attractive/functional web applications.

I look forward to collaborating with like minded developers in the future and working to make valuable contributions to the industry.

Till we meet...

Reeve Jarvis ‚úåÔ∏è
