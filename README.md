# Hi there üëã 

My name is Reeve Jarvis, and I am an aspiring developer.


## About me:

I am 28 years old, and have made the decision to return to school and pursue a career in tech. I am currently studying at North Island College, on beautiful Vancouver Island in Canada. I am a huge gamer and hope to someday get involved in the video game industry.

I am in the second year of my program and I am currently learning the following:

 - Swift programming for iOS development
 - Applied JavaScript techniques for web development
 - PHP programming and database integrations
 - Advanced CSS techniques for web development
 - Content Management systems and Wordpress development

My commits/contributions thus far on GitHub are entirely school related, ranging from simple websites to android mobile applications. I can not wait to complete my program and continue growing my skillset in the workplace. 

I will be launching a developer profile website in the future in order to provide a point of contact for prospective employers and to showcase my talents.

I look forward to collaborating with like minded developers in the future and working to make valuable contributions to the industry.

Till we meet...
